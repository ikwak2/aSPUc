### aSPUc

Some (aSPU)[https://github.com/ikwak2/aSPU] functions coded using C++ (aSPUperm2C, aSPUsPath2C, aSPUpath2C and aSPUsPathC). They are all much faster than R coded version, but didn't passed R CRAN test. So, I upload them here separately.

### installation
With `devtools`:
```S
library(devtools)
install_github("ikwak2/aSPU")
```
