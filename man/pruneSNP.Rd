\title{Prune SNPs (related to aSPUs, aSPUsPath, MTaSPUsSet)}
\usage{
pruneSNP(corSNP, rup = 0.95, rdown = -0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{corSNP}{Correlation matirx of the SNPs to be tested; estimated from a
reference panel (based on the same set of the reference alleles as
used in calculating Z-scores).}

\item{rup}{pruning criteria, erase one SNP when correlation between two SNPs are larger than this value.}

\item{rdown}{pruning criteria, erase one SNP when correlation between two SNPs are smaller than this value.}
}
\value{
a list object pruned.corSNP and to.erase. pruned.corSNP is pruned correlation matrix. to.erase is SNP index to erase to get purned object. (i.e. corSNP[-to.erase, -to.erase] = pruned.corSNP )
}
\description{
When correlation matirx have highly correlated SNPs, the performance of aSPUs, aSPUsPath and MTaSPUsSet are not very good. Do pruning using this function.

\examples{


data(kegg9)
## example analysis using aSPUM test.
g <- kegg9$gene.info[1,1]  #  SOAT1 
## Take snps mapped on gene "SOAT1" from the information of gene.info and snp.info. 
snps <- which( ( kegg9$snp.info[,2] == kegg9$gene.info[kegg9$gene.info[,1] == g, 2] ) &
                 (kegg9$snp.info[,3] > kegg9$gene.info[kegg9$gene.info[,1] == g, 3] ) &
                 (kegg9$snp.info[,3] < kegg9$gene.info[kegg9$gene.info[,1] == g, 4] )  )
## Take subsets
newP <- kegg9$nP[snps] ;
ldsub <- kegg9$ldmatrix[snps, snps];

prSNP <- pruneSNP(ldsub) 
newP <- newP[-prSNP$to.erase]
ldsub <- ldsub[-prSNP$to.erase, -prSNP$to.erase ]

## Get p-value for gene SOAT1. Read vignette for details.
out <- aSPUs(newP, corSNP=ldsub , pow=c(1:8, Inf), n.perm=100, Ps=TRUE)

# This is a vector of Test Statistics for SPUM and aSPUM tests.
# SPUs1 to SPUsInf corresponds with the option pow=c(1:8, Inf)
# They are SPUs test statistics.
# The last element aSPUs is minimum of them, aSPUs statistic.

out$pvs
# This is a vector of p-values for SPUs and aSPUs tests.
# SPUs1 to SPUsInf corresponds with the option pow=c(1:8, Inf)
# They are p-values for corresponding SPUs tests.
# The last element is p-value of aSPUs test.
